üå≥ Red-Black Tree Implementation in C++

This project is a custom implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C++ that demonstrates key concepts of balanced binary search trees, including insertion, rebalancing, and traversal. It also includes additional features such as iterators for in-order traversal and a newly added level-order traversal for visualizing the tree structure.

üöÄ Features:

Template-based map Class: Supports generic key-value pairs for maximum flexibility.
Red-Black Tree Properties: Ensures a balanced binary search tree with rotations to maintain the properties of red-black trees.
Insertion with Rebalancing: Includes logic for maintaining tree balance and color properties during insertions.
Custom Iterators: Facilitates in-order traversal of the tree structure.
Level-Order Traversal: Implements breadth-first search to display tree nodes by levels.
üõ†Ô∏è Code Highlights
Insertion with Rotations: Implements left and right rotations for maintaining tree balance.
Iterators: Simplifies in-order traversal for accessing sorted key-value pairs.
Level-Order Traversal: Uses a queue to perform breadth-first search and print the tree nodes level by level.
Example: Level-Order Traversal Output
{(key, 60) : (value, 4) : (color, black)}

{(key, 25) : (value, 2) : (color, black)}

{(key, 75) : (value, 7) : (color, black)}

{(key, 10) : (value, 1) : (color, black)}

{(key, 50) : (value, 3) : (color, black)}

{(key, 65) : (value, 5) : (color, black)}

{(key, 85) : (value, 9) : (color, red)}

{(key, 70) : (value, 6) : (color, red)}

{(key, 80) : (value, 8) : (color, black)}

{(key, 90) : (value, 10) : (color, black)}

{(key, 95) : (value, 11) : (color, red)}

üîç Example Use Cases
This implementation can serve as the foundation for learning or building applications that require efficient key-value storage, such as:

Databases: For indexing and search optimizations.
Memory Management: As an allocator in operating systems.
Gaming Engines: For fast state lookups and AI decision-making trees.
